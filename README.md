# A click leaves a colored dot on the screen with undo and redo functionality in React

## Problem case :
#### * The user can click anywhere on this page and when they click on this position you need to put a circle in thaht place
#### * Add two butons for undoing and redoing those click posistions

To solve that case i used React :
* useState hook,
* destructuring,
* mapping.
