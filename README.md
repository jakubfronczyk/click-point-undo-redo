# A click leaves a colored dot on the screen with undo and redo functionality in React

### Problem case :
* The user can click anywhere on this page and when they click on this position you need to put a circle in thaht place
* Add two butons for undoing and redoing those click posistions

To solve that case i used React :
* useState hook
* destructuring
* mapping
